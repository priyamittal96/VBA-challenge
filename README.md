## Stock Market Analysis Project

The following files in the respository include a VBA script that was run on multi-year stock data and screenshots of each corresponding year in the data (2014, 2015, and 2016). 

The VBA script loops through each of the worksheets to pull separate ticker symbols, the corresponding yearly change between opening price and closing price for the given year, the percent change between opening price and closing price of the given year, along with the total stock volume. 

In each of the screenshots, the positive yearly change is denoted with a green highlighted cell and negative yearly changes are denoted with a red highlighted cell. 

## Technologies

The VBA script was generated under the Visual Basic developer in Excel and the data was run through the Visual Basic as well. The script was exported as .txt file and uploaded into this repository.
